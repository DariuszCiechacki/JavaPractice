/**
 * ================= GENERICS BASICS =================
 * Generics allow you to write classes, interfaces, and methods that operate on types specified as parameters.
 * Instead of writing code for every possible type, you write it once with a placeholder for the type.
 * Key Points:
 * Type Parameters:
 * Written in angle brackets < >.
 * Common names:
 * - T → Type
 * - E → Element (used in collections)
 * - K → Key
 * - V → Value
